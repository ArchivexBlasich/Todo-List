# Todo List

[Live Preview](https://archivexblasich.github.io/Todo-List/)

A simple todo list app built as part of The Odin Project.  
The focus of this project was practicing modular JavaScript, separating application logic from the DOM, and using localStorage for persistence.

---

## What I Practiced
- Creating todo objects with properties like title, description, due date, and priority.
- Organizing todos into projects (default and custom).
- Keeping application logic separate from DOM code.
- Saving and loading data with localStorage.

---

## Features
- Create projects and add todos to them.
- View all todos in a project with title and due date.
- Delete todos or projects.
- Visual indicators for priority levels.
- Data is saved in localStorage so it persists after refresh.

---

## Tech
- JavaScript (ES Modules with Webpack)  
- HTML and CSS  
- localStorage
